An attempt to recreate VidAngle for YouTube

VidAngle is a fantastic service that filters out vilance, profanity, and sexual content. When in beta, they provided their service free of charge for YouTubers. Now that they have offically released their product, filtering support for YouTube videos had been withdrawn (and for obvious business reasons).

For all original VidAngle beta-users and other interested YouTubers out there, Guardian is an attempt to become an open-source service similar to VidAngle, allowing users to watch their favorite movies on YouTube with peace of mind. It takes advantage of the YouTube API to 'bleep' and 'skip' over content based on pre-user-defined filters.
