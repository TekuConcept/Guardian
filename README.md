An attempt to recreate VidAngle for YouTube

VidAngle is a fantastic service that filters out vilance, profanity, and sexual content. When in beta, they provided there service free of charge for YouTubers. Now that they have offically released their service, filtering support for YouTube videos had been withdrawn (and for obvious business reasons).

For all VidAngle beta-users and YouTubers, Guardian is an attempt to become an open-source service similar to VidAngle, specifically for YouTube.
